I'm currently a Lecturer in Psychological Research Methods based in the Clinical Psychology department at the University of Edinburgh. I migrated from a fixed-term role in the Psychology department, where they have an [excellent Data Analysis teaching team](https://uoepsy.github.io/). Working with them inspired me to develop and design my own open-access materials, leading to what you see here. 
  
I recognise that most Psychology students consider statistics to be boring, difficult, and/or anxiety provoking. I love the challenge of presenting these concepts in a way that's engaging and generally accessible to a wide audience. 

When I'm not teaching stats, answering emails, or buried under a pile of marking, I like exploring new places with my family, eating really good food, and hitting things really hard (AKA doing Muay Thai).
