### Course Description
This course aims to provide students with both a theoretical and practical understanding of inferential statistics and their use in psychology. It is aimed primarily at postgraduate students who have completed an undergraduate degree in Psychology or a cognate subject, and who have a basic understanding of statistical principles and assumptions, including the ability to conduct descriptive statistics. The course will cover a range of statistical methods and content, such as t-tests, correlation, regression, and mediation. After taking this course, students should be able to make choices regarding the appropriate use of statistical tests dependent on research questions, independently run statistical analysis, and interpret and effectively report analysis results.

This course is currently undergoing refurbishment, so most of the lectures will overlap with those from Psychological Research Methods. Here, you can find a few additional lectures. More will be added as the course is updated.
